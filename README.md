            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Orion is a Python-based voice assistant capable of performing various tasks, including web searches, opening applications, responding with speech, and interacting with Google Generative AI for more complex queries.

            <h2>Key Technologies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Converts spoken commands into text.</li>
                <li><strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> Converts text responses into spoken words.</li>
                <li><strong>App Automation:</strong> Allows control and automation of various applications.</li>
                <li><strong>API-based Interactions:</strong> Integrates with Google services for advanced queries and tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                The assistant listens for voice commands, processes them, and executes tasks or returns spoken responses. Here is a brief overview of its workflow:
            </p>
            <pre>
                1. User gives a voice command.
                2. Speech Recognition converts the voice command to text.
                3. The text command is processed.
                4. Relevant actions are performed, or responses are generated using Google Generative AI.
                5. Text-to-Speech converts the response into spoken words.
                6. The assistant provides the spoken response to the user.
            </pre>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To start the Orion assistant, run the following Python script:</p>
    <pre><code>python orion.py</code></pre>
    <p>Once the script is running, Orion will begin listening for voice commands and respond accordingly. You can use Orion to perform various tasks, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open websites:</strong> E.g., "Open YouTube"</li>
        <li><strong>Search on YouTube:</strong> E.g., "Search for Python tutorials on YouTube"</li>
        <li><strong>Open installed applications:</strong> E.g., "Open Google Chrome"</li>
        <li><strong>Query Google Generative AI:</strong> E.g., "What's the weather like today?"</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor system performance:</strong> E.g., "What's the CPU usage?"</li>
    </ul>
</section>


<section>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Orion operates through a series of integrated components to process and execute voice commands:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Uses the microphone to listen for voice commands and converts them into text.</li>
        <li><strong>Command Processing:</strong> Interprets the text commands using Googleâ€™s speech recognition service and determines the appropriate action.</li>
        <li><strong>Task Execution:</strong> Based on the interpreted command, Orion performs the requested tasks. This may include opening applications, searching the web, or querying Google Generative AI.</li>
        <li><strong>Response:</strong> Provides feedback to the user either through text-to-speech or displays the result in the terminal.</li>
    </ol>
</section>


<section>
    <h2>Example Commands</h2>
    <p>Here are some example commands you can use with Orion:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Open YouTube"</li>
        <li>"Search for Python tutorials on Google"</li>
        <li>"Send a WhatsApp message"</li>
        <li>"What's the CPU usage?"</li>
    </ul>
